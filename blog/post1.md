Welcome to my very first blog post! In this post, I want to share my steps in building my open portfolio.

## Getting Started

I have started learning web development for same times ago and made some programs, but did not used it for my promotion. Now I will do it serious.

At thiw first step i focuse on:

- HTML for structuring content
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for interactivity

## Perpose of the Portfolio
# My Personal Portfolio

I created this personal portfolio to showcase my skills and projects.

## What My Portfolio Shows Right Now

1. Organizing HTML into reusable sections
2. Using JavaScript to dynamically load content
3. Interactive design with accordion sections
4. Dynamically inserting HTML (as in my blog)
