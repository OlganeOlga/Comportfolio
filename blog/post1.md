Welcome to my very first blog post! In this post, I want to share my steps in building my open portfolio.

# My Personal Portfolio

I created this personal portfolio to showcase my skills and projects.

## What My Portfolio Shows Right Now

1. Organizing HTML into reusable sections
2. Using JavaScript to dynamically load content
3. Interactive design with accordion sections
4. Dynamically inserting HTML (as in my blog)
